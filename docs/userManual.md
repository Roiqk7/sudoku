# Sudoku!

If you are struggling to run the game, please refer to the [installation guide](installation.md).

## How does it work?

Once you run the application, you should be greeted with the welcome scene. Click anywhere to continue. Then you will find yourself in the main menu. From here you can start a new game. Simply click on the new game button.

Once you pick a difficulty which ranges from easy to expert, you will be taken to the game of Sudoku! There you are greeted with couple of buttons. On the top left of the sudoku grid you can find the pause button.

Clicking on the pause button will pause the game and you will be taken to the pause menu. From there you can resume the game, get help or go back to the main menu.

Then you will see the sudoku grid. You can click on any cell to select it. The game offers a highlight to better see the selected cell. You can then select a number to insert from the number pad on the right. Beware that the number you select from the number pad will stay toggled on so you can insert the same number multiple times. So before clicking on an empty cell, make sure you have the right number toggled on.

If you are stuck, you can click on the hint button on the right of the sudoku grid. The hint button will give you a hint on a random cell. If you are still stuck, you can click on the solve button which will solve the entire sudoku board for you. But using the solve button will end the game and your run will be invalidated.

Lastly there is the notes switch bellow the hint button to toggle notes. When notes are toggled on, you can insert multiple numbers in a cell. This is useful for keeping track of possible numbers in a cell.
