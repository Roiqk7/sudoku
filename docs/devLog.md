# Developer's Log

## 01/12/2024 v1.0.0

The first version of the project was released today. The project is not fully finished but I have have other priorities at the moment. I will hopefully finish it by hopping back every so often. As of right now the most important thing missing is the timer and more tests. Otherwise its just regular matter as refactoring and cleaning up the code. Hopefully the game as it is now is playable and enjoyable. Feel free to report any bugs or issues you find and I will try to fix them as soon as possible. Thank you for playing!
